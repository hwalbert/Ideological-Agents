This repository supports research that seeks to uncover empirical distributions of political ideology and use them to model an electoral process where voters choose candidates based on the voter’s self-interest. I construct an agent-based model using three dimensions of empirical distributions of ideology. Over the course of a campaign, voters update their preference for a candidate based on their unique position in their social network and their unique position in 3D political ideology space. Voters can influence other voters perceptions of the likelihood that their preferred candidate will win. In addition candidates are able to respond to the the “polls” they take of voters and are able to make known updated policy positions in an effort to find more voters.
